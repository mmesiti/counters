* Performance Calculations
Performance calculations for:
- FLOP per site
- Memory used by the local process (this number could be used with FLOP to get an estimate
  of the arithmetic intensity )
- size of MPI data transfers

It is assumed that the lattice is parallelised in all 4 directions (this simplifies slightly the
computation of the halo size).

** Main Ideas
The calculations are laid out explicitly so that they should be straighforward to
check and fix.
In order to be able to check the intermediate results, the same code can be loaded in a python
REPL, thanks to a careful (ab)use of the C preprocessor.
** Usage
*** Python modules
To build the python modules, use
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make python
#+END_SRC
 = yapf =  is used to reformat the output if available (not necessary).
*** C libraries
The C files can be included or compiled without issues, but some symbols must be defined
(i.e.,  = NF = ,  = T = ,  = X = ,  = Y = ,  = Z =  and the size of the floating point datatype chosen,  = REAL_SIZE = ).
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make c
#+END_SRC
 = clang-format =  is used to reformat the output is available (not necessary).
*** Compilation of C libraries
To test the compilation of the C code, use
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make testo
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: make: Nothing to be done for 'testo'.

In this case, some default values are used for the symbols mentioned above.
